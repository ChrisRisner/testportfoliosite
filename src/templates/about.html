    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>My name is Chris and I'm a (very) amateur photographer located in Seattle, Washington.  I've always been interested in photography and decided to start sharing some of my pictures online.  </p>
    <p>I've been shooting on Nikon cameras for about a decade now.  My first was a Nikon D3500 DSLR, followed by a Z50.  I currently shoot with a Z8.  For my phone camera, I'm currently using a Pixel 10 Pro XL.</p>
    <p>This site is a more or less blatant rip off of <a href="https://stephanfoto.com">Stephan Morais' Photography site.</a></p>
