## Changes



* Use the metadata file in generating album pages
    DONE Pre-process step to generate a metadata file for each album including exif info per photo, title, album title, album subtitle

* Evaluate google analytics or alternatives
* add Robots.txt
* Add detail to about page - reference where we stole design from
* Check to make sure site is cached through cloudflare


Low priority
* Consider loading thumbnails for pictures on album page and only go full version when needed
* Figure out why lazy load of images - isn't working
